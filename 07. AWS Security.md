# Encryption Mechanisms in AWS

#### 1. **Encryption in Flight**
- **TLS/SSL**: 
  - **Definition**: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the modern version of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
  - **Process**: Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving.
  - **Use Case**: Secures communication between a client and a server over a network.
  - **How It Works**: Utilizes TLS certificates for encryption, ensuring that only the target server can decrypt the data.
  - **Example**: HTTPS websites use TLS to encrypt data between the user's browser and the web server.
  - **Importance**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring data is securely transmitted over potentially insecure networks.

#### 2. **Server-Side Encryption at Rest**
- **Definition**: Data is encrypted after being received by the server and decrypted before being sent back to the client.
- **Process**:
  - Data received by the server is decrypted.
  - A data key is used to encrypt the data before storing it.
  - Upon retrieval, the encrypted data and the data key are used to decrypt the data before sending it back to the client.
- **Example**: Amazon S3 can store objects with server-side encryption.
  - **Process in S3**: An object sent to S3 over HTTP or HTTPS is decrypted upon receipt, encrypted with a data key, and stored. Upon request, the encrypted object is decrypted and sent back to the client over HTTPS.
- **Importance**: Ensures data is securely stored, preventing unauthorized access to data at rest.

#### 3. **Client-Side Encryption**
- **Definition**: Data is encrypted and decrypted on the client side, with the server never having access to the unencrypted data.
- **Process**:
  - The client uses a data key to encrypt the data.
  - The encrypted data is sent to a storage service.
  - The server stores the data in its encrypted form without decrypting it.
  - Upon retrieval, the encrypted data is sent back to the client, who then uses the data key to decrypt it.
- **Use Case**: Used when the client does not trust the server to handle unencrypted data.
- **Example**: Data stored in Amazon S3, EBS volumes, or any storage service can be encrypted by the client before uploading and decrypted upon retrieval.
- **Importance**: Provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that only the client can decrypt the data, even if the storage service is compromised.

### Summary
- **Encryption in Flight (TLS/SSL)**: Secures data transmission over networks.
- **Server-Side Encryption at Rest**: Secures stored data by encrypting it on the server.
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Secures data by encrypting it before sending to the server, ensuring the server never has access to the unencrypted data.

Understanding these encryption mechanisms is crucial for managing and protecting data in the cloud. Each method offers different levels of security and trust, catering to various use cases and requirements.

# Detailed Explanation of AWS KMS Encryption and Decryption

#### KMS Encrypt and Decrypt APIs

**Encrypt API Workflow:**
1. **Secret Data**: Assume you have a secret, such as a password, that is less than 4 KB.
2. **Encryption Request**: Use the encrypt API via AWS SDK or CLI, specifying the Customer Master Key (CMK).
3. **IAM Check**: KMS verifies if you have the necessary permissions.
4. **Encryption**: If permissions are valid, KMS encrypts the secret.
5. **Response**: KMS returns the encrypted secret (ciphertext).

**Decrypt API Workflow:**
1. **Decryption Request**: Use the decrypt API via AWS SDK or CLI, with the encrypted data.
2. **Automatic Key Identification**: KMS identifies the CMK used for encryption.
3. **IAM Check**: KMS checks if you have permissions to decrypt.
4. **Decryption**: If permissions are valid, KMS decrypts the data.
5. **Response**: KMS returns the decrypted secret in plain text.

#### Envelope Encryption

Envelope encryption is used for encrypting data larger than 4 KB by utilizing a two-step process involving data keys (DEK) and CMKs.

**GenerateDataKey API Workflow:**
1. **Request**: Use the GenerateDataKey API, specifying a CMK.
2. **IAM Check**: KMS checks if you have permissions to generate a data key.
3. **Key Generation**: If permissions are valid, KMS generates a DEK.
4. **Response**: KMS returns both the plaintext DEK and the encrypted DEK.

**Client-Side Encryption Process:**
1. **Encrypt Data**: Use the plaintext DEK to encrypt the large file client-side.
2. **Create Envelope**: The final encrypted file contains:
   - Encrypted data
   - Encrypted DEK

**Decrypting the Envelope:**
1. **Extract DEK**: Extract the encrypted DEK from the envelope.
2. **Decrypt DEK**: Use the decrypt API to decrypt the encrypted DEK.
3. **Decrypt Data**: Use the plaintext DEK to decrypt the large file client-side.

#### AWS Encryption SDK

AWS provides an encryption SDK to simplify envelope encryption. It supports multiple programming languages and has features like data key caching.

**Data Key Caching:**
- **Purpose**: Reduce KMS API calls by reusing DEKs.
- **Configuration**: Define cache parameters such as max age, max number of bytes encrypted, or max number of messages encrypted per DEK.

#### Key APIs to Remember

1. **Encrypt**: Encrypts up to 4 KB of data directly using KMS.
2. **GenerateDataKey**: Generates a DEK for client-side encryption.
   - Returns both plaintext and encrypted DEK.
3. **GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext**: Generates an encrypted DEK for future use without providing plaintext.
4. **Decrypt**: Decrypts up to 4 KB of data or the DEK used in envelope encryption.
5. **GenerateRandom**: Generates a random byte string.

This comprehensive understanding of KMS APIs and envelope encryption helps manage encryption for both small and large data effectively, leveraging AWS's powerful cryptographic capabilities.

# Handling KMS Throttling and Request Quotas

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a critical inner service used for cryptographic operations. Due to its importance, there are request quotas to ensure fair usage and service stability. If you exceed these quotas, you'll encounter a `ThrottlingException`.

#### Understanding KMS Quotas

- **Quota Sharing**: All cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt, GenerateDataKey, GenerateRandom, etc.) share a common quota. This includes requests made on your behalf by other AWS services, like S3 using SSE-KMS.
- **Quota Limits**: The specific quota value depends on the region. Typically, you have:
  - 5,500 requests per second in some regions.
  - Up to 10,000 requests per second in other regions.
  - Up to 30,000 requests per second in high-demand regions.

#### Responding to Throttling

When you exceed the KMS request quota, you'll receive a `ThrottlingException` with a status code of 400. Hereâ€™s how you can handle it:

1. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Implement exponential backoff to manage transient throttling issues. This involves backing off and retrying with increasing time intervals between each attempt.

2. **Data Encryption Key (DEK) Caching**:
   - If you frequently use the `GenerateDataKey` API, implement DEK caching locally. This reduces the number of API calls to KMS.
   - DEK caching is a feature of the AWS Encryption SDK and helps mitigate throttling by reusing the data encryption key for multiple operations instead of generating a new one each time.

3. **Request Quota Increase**:
   - If you consistently hit the quota limit, request a quota increase. This can be done through:
     - An API call to request the increase.
     - Opening a support ticket with AWS Support to increase your limit.
   - Increasing the quota ensures that your applications can handle the required number of cryptographic operations without throttling.

#### Steps to Implement Solutions

1. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Implement a retry logic in your application with exponentially increasing wait times between retries.
   - Example pseudocode:
     ```python
     import time
     import random

     def exponential_backoff(retries):
         return min(2 ** retries + random.uniform(0, 1), 60)

     retries = 0
     max_retries = 10
     while retries < max_retries:
         try:
             # Perform KMS operation
             break
         except ThrottlingException:
             wait_time = exponential_backoff(retries)
             time.sleep(wait_time)
             retries += 1
     ```

2. **Data Encryption Key (DEK) Caching**:
   - Use the AWS Encryption SDK to implement DEK caching.
   - Example setup:
     ```python
     from aws_encryption_sdk import EncryptionSDKClient, LocalCryptoMaterialsCache, CachingCryptoMaterialsManager

     cache = LocalCryptoMaterialsCache(capacity=100)
     caching_cmm = CachingCryptoMaterialsManager(
         master_key_provider=your_master_key_provider,
         cache=cache,
         max_age=600,  # 10 minutes
         max_messages_encrypted=100
     )

     client = EncryptionSDKClient()

     ciphertext, encryptor_header = client.encrypt(
         source=plaintext,
         materials_manager=caching_cmm
     )
     ```

3. **Requesting a Quota Increase**:
   - **Through AWS Support**:
     - Navigate to the AWS Support Center and create a new support case requesting a quota increase for KMS.
   - **Using an API**:
     - Use the AWS Service Quotas API to request a quota increase.
     - Example:
       ```python
       import boto3

       client = boto3.client('service-quotas')

       response = client.request_service_quota_increase(
           ServiceCode='kms',
           QuotaCode='L-12345678',
           DesiredValue=20000  # Your desired quota limit
       )
       ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage KMS throttling and ensure that your cryptographic operations continue smoothly without interruption.

# Using AWS Lambda with KMS for Encrypting Environment Variables

#### Objective
We aim to securely store and use sensitive information, such as database passwords, within AWS Lambda functions by leveraging AWS KMS for encryption.

#### Steps to Securely Store Environment Variables

1. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - Name the function `LambdaKMS`.
   - Use the Python runtime.

2. **Setting Up Environment Variables**:
   - **Unencrypted Variable**: Initially, you may have the database password (`DB_PASSWORD`) hardcoded or as a plain text environment variable, which is not secure.

3. **Encrypting Environment Variables with KMS**:
   - Navigate to the Lambda functionâ€™s configuration and locate the environment variables section.
   - Add your sensitive variable, e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`, with the value `super_secret`.
   - Enable encryption for this environment variable using a KMS key.
   - Select the tutorial KMS key created earlier and encrypt the variable.

4. **Decrypting Environment Variables in Code**:
   - Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to decrypt the environment variable within the Lambda function.
   - Copy and use the provided decrypt secret snippet from the Lambda console.

5. **Example Code**:
   ```python
   import os
   import boto3
   from base64 import b64decode

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Encrypted environment variable
       encrypted_db_password = os.environ['DB_PASSWORD']
       
       # Decrypting the environment variable using KMS
       kms_client = boto3.client('kms')
       decrypted_db_password = kms_client.decrypt(
           CiphertextBlob=b64decode(encrypted_db_password),
           EncryptionContext={'LambdaFunctionName': context.function_name}
       )['Plaintext'].decode('utf-8')
       
       # Print statements for testing (in production, avoid logging sensitive information)
       print("Encrypted DB Password:", encrypted_db_password)
       print("Decrypted DB Password:", decrypted_db_password)
       
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': 'Great'
       }
   ```

6. **Configure Lambda Execution Role**:
   - Ensure the Lambda execution role has permissions to decrypt using the specified KMS key.
   - Attach an inline policy to the role:
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:key/KEY_ID"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

7. **Testing and Adjustments**:
   - Set the Lambda function timeout to a sufficient duration (e.g., 10 seconds).
   - Test the function to ensure it works as expected and can decrypt the environment variable.
   - Handle access denied exceptions by ensuring the IAM role has the correct permissions.

#### Summary

This process ensures that sensitive information such as database passwords are securely managed in AWS Lambda. By encrypting environment variables with KMS and decrypting them in the function, sensitive data remains protected and is not exposed in the code or configuration settings.

# Optimizing S3 Bucket Encryption with SSE-KMS and Bucket Keys

#### Introduction
Amazon S3 now offers a setting to reduce the number of API calls to AWS KMS by up to 99% when using SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service). This setting, known as the S3 bucket key, significantly reduces costs and API call limits while maintaining security.

#### How It Works
1. **Customer Master Key (CMK) and Data Key**:
   - A CMK in KMS generates a data key for your S3 bucket periodically.
   - This data key, known as the S3 bucket key, rotates occasionally.

2. **Using the S3 Bucket Key**:

# KMS Key Policies

KMS key policies define who has access to your KMS key and specify what actions they can perform. Understanding and properly configuring these policies is crucial for maintaining security and ensuring appropriate access control.

#### Default KMS Key Policy
- When you create a KMS key through the AWS Console, the default key policy typically grants access to all users within the account, provided they have the necessary IAM permissions.
- This means any user with appropriate IAM permissions can access and use the KMS key.

#### Explicit Authorization
- You can explicitly authorize specific users, roles, or services to use your KMS key.
- This explicit permission can be given without needing additional IAM policies.

#### Types of Principals in KMS Key Policies
1. **Account and Root User**:
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:root"}`
   - This grants access to every principal within the specified account, with further control managed by IAM policies.

2. **Specific IAM Roles**:
   - You can grant permissions to a specific IAM role by specifying its ARN.
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"}`

3. **IAM Role Sessions**:
   - Used for assumed roles or federated identities (e.g., through AWS Cognito or SAML).
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_ID:assumed-role/ROLE_NAME/SESSION_NAME"}`

4. **IAM Users**:
   - You can grant access to specific IAM users within the account or from another account.
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/USER_NAME"}`

5. **Federated User Sessions**:
   - Specifies federated users who have authenticated through an external identity provider.
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_ID:federated-user/USER_NAME"}`

6. **Specific Services**:
   - Grants access to specific AWS services to use the KMS key.
   - Example: `"Principal": {"Service": "SERVICE_NAME.amazonaws.com"}`

7. **Wildcard (*)**:
   - Allows access to everyone and everything.
   - Example: `"Principal": {"AWS": "*"}` or `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:*"}`

#### Example Key Policy
Here's a sample KMS key policy that grants a specific IAM user and a specific IAM role the permissions to use the key for encryption and decryption:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "key-default-1",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/USER_NAME",
          "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- This policy explicitly allows the IAM user `USER_NAME` and the IAM role `ROLE_NAME` to perform specified KMS actions.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Default Policies**: Provide broad access within the account, controlled further by IAM permissions.
- **Explicit Policies**: Allow for more granular control, specifying exact principals and actions.
- **Principal Types**: Include root users, specific IAM roles and users, federated identities, services, and wildcard permissions.
