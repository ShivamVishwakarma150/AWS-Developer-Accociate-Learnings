# Creating a Second Beanstalk Environment for Production

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a New Environment**:
   - Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk console and start creating a new environment.
   - Choose "Web server environment" for the environment type.
   - Name this environment "prod" to indicate it's for production, complementing the existing development environment.

2. **Platform and Application Code**:
   - Select the managed platform "Node.js".
   - Use the same sample application as the development environment to keep consistency.

3. **Preset Configuration**:
   - This time, choose "High Availability" instead of "Single Instance".
   - This configuration ensures the application can handle higher traffic and provides failover capabilities.

4. **Service Role**:
   - Use the existing service role created during the setup of the development environment.

5. **Optional Configurations**:
   - **Networking**:
     - If you have specific VPC requirements, select them. Choose the VPC and the subnets where you want to launch the instances.
     - For high availability, select all available subnets.
     - Do not assign public IP addresses to the EC2 instances, as the load balancer will handle public traffic.
   - **Database**:
     - Decide if you need a database. Remember, a database created within the Beanstalk environment is tied to its lifecycle, meaning it will be deleted if the environment is deleted. You can snapshot the database to mitigate this.

6. **Instance Configuration**:
   - Set up instance details, such as instance type (e.g., t3.micro), root volume settings, and security groups.
   - Configure the auto-scaling group:
     - Set minimum and maximum capacity (e.g., 1 to 4 instances).
     - Choose the instance types and possibly mix On-Demand and Spot instances.
     - Set scaling policies based on metrics such as average CPU utilization.

7. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   - Specify the load balancer details:
     - Choose between an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB).
     - Configure the ALB with listeners, target groups, and subnet associations.
     - Decide if you want a dedicated load balancer for this environment or share one across multiple environments to save costs.

8. **Health Reporting and Monitoring**:
   - Configure health checks and reporting:
     - Use enhanced health reporting for better visibility.
     - Optionally, set up email notifications for critical events and enable rolling updates.

9. **Platform Software and Logging**:
   - Decide if you want to integrate Amazon X-Ray for tracing and debugging.
   - Configure log streaming to CloudWatch Logs for better log management.

10. **Review and Submit**:
    - Review all configurations to ensure correctness.
    - Submit the setup to launch the new environment. This process may take around 10 minutes.

#### Monitoring and Verifying the Environment

1. **Environment Status**:
   - Once the environment is ready, access it using the provided domain name to verify it's running correctly.
   - Ensure the sample application is functioning as expected.

2. **Load Balancer and EC2 Instances**:
   - Check the Load Balancers section in the AWS Management Console:
     - Verify the load balancer is deployed across multiple availability zones.
     - Ensure the load balancer has healthy target groups with the correct EC2 instances.
   - Verify the EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling Groups section:
     - Confirm the instances are in service and scaling policies are in place.
     - Check security groups to ensure proper network traffic flow.

3. **Environment Comparison**:
   - Now, you have two environments: one for development and one for production.
   - Each environment can be managed independently, allowing for separate configurations, deployments, and scaling policies.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up a high availability production environment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, demonstrating its capability to handle more complex configurations and scaling needs while maintaining simplicity in deployment and management.

# Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Strategies

When updating your application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk, several deployment options are available. Each method has its own advantages and trade-offs, particularly concerning downtime, deployment speed, and cost. Below is an overview of these deployment strategies:

1. **All at Once Deployment**:
   - **Process**: Deploys the new version to all instances simultaneously.
   - **Pros**: Fastest deployment method.
   - **Cons**: Causes downtime as all instances are updated at the same time.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for development environments where downtime is acceptable.

2. **Rolling Deployment**:
   - **Process**: Updates a subset of instances (a "bucket") at a time. When the first bucket is healthy, it moves on to the next.
   - **Pros**: Reduces downtime since not all instances are down simultaneously.
   - **Cons**: Application runs below capacity during the update. The deployment is slower than all at once.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where partial downtime is acceptable.

3. **Rolling with Additional Batch Deployment**:
   - **Process**: Similar to rolling, but additional instances are created temporarily to ensure full capacity during the update.
   - **Pros**: Maintains full capacity throughout the deployment.
   - **Cons**: Slight additional cost due to the temporary extra instances. Deployment time is longer.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for production environments requiring full capacity with minimal impact on performance.

4. **Immutable Deployment**:
   - **Process**: Deploys new instances in a temporary Auto Scaling group (ASG) and replaces the old instances once the new ones are healthy.
   - **Pros**: Zero downtime, quick rollback capability.
   - **Cons**: Higher cost due to doubled capacity during deployment. Longest deployment time.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for critical production environments where downtime and rollback speed are crucial.

5. **Blue/Green Deployment**:
   - **Process**: Creates a separate environment (green) for the new version while the existing environment (blue) continues to serve traffic. Switches traffic to the green environment once it’s validated.
   - **Pros**: Zero downtime, allows thorough testing before switching traffic.
   - **Cons**: Manual setup and management. Higher cost due to maintaining two environments.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for production environments needing thorough testing before deployment.

6. **Traffic Splitting (Canary Testing)**:
   - **Process**: Deploys the new version to a temporary ASG and directs a small percentage of traffic to it. If the deployment is successful, the new version is gradually adopted.
   - **Pros**: Zero downtime, automated rollback if issues are detected.
   - **Cons**: Slightly higher cost due to temporary additional capacity.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for gradual rollout and real-world testing with minimal risk.

### Detailed Description with Diagrams

1. **All at Once**:
   - Initial State: Four EC2 instances running version 1 (v1).
   - Deployment: All instances stop serving traffic, deploy version 2 (v2) simultaneously.
   - Result: Fast deployment with a brief period of downtime.

2. **Rolling**:
   - Initial State: Four EC2 instances running v1.
   - Deployment: Update instances in buckets (e.g., two instances at a time).
   - Result: Application runs at reduced capacity during deployment but avoids total downtime.

3. **Rolling with Additional Batch**:
   - Initial State: Four EC2 instances running v1.
   - Deployment: Create additional instances temporarily to maintain full capacity during the update.
   - Result: Ensures full capacity with a minor additional cost. Deployment is slower due to the creation of temporary instances.

4. **Immutable**:
   - Initial State: Three instances in ASG running v1.
   - Deployment: Create new ASG with instances running v2. Replace old instances with new ones.
   - Result: Zero downtime, high cost, longest deployment time, and quick rollback if needed.

5. **Blue/Green**:
   - Initial State: Blue environment (current) running v1.
   - Deployment: Create green environment running v2. Use Route 53 to direct traffic.
   - Result: Thorough testing possible with zero downtime. Manual and costly process.

6. **Traffic Splitting**:
   - Initial State: Main ASG running v1.
   - Deployment: Create temporary ASG with v2. Direct a small percentage of traffic to it.
   - Result: Automated canary testing with quick rollback if necessary. Slightly higher cost due to temporary ASG.

### Summary of Deployment Strategies

- **Impact of Failed Deployment**: Varies from quick rollback (Immutable, Traffic Splitting) to more manual rollbacks (Blue/Green).
- **Deployment Time**: Ranges from fastest (All at Once) to longest (Immutable).
- **Downtime**: Zero downtime options include Immutable, Blue/Green, and Traffic Splitting.
- **Additional Cost**: Varies from no additional cost (All at Once, Rolling) to higher costs (Immutable, Blue/Green).

Each deployment strategy should be chosen based on the specific requirements, constraints, and criticality of the environment. By understanding these deployment methods, you can select the most appropriate one for your application updates in AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

# Managing Elastic Beanstalk Application Versions with Lifecycle Policies

Elastic Beanstalk allows up to 1000 application versions per account. To manage this effectively and prevent deployment issues due to reaching this limit, you can implement a lifecycle policy. Here's how you can set up and use a lifecycle policy in Elastic Beanstalk:

### Steps to Implement Lifecycle Policy

1. **Accessing Application Versions**:
   - Navigate to the "Application Versions" section under your specific application in Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Here, you can see all the deployed versions, including details like labels, sources, and locations.

2. **Source Bundles in S3**:
   - Elastic Beanstalk stores application versions as source bundles in an S3 bucket. 
   - You can access these bundles in the S3 management console by searching for the Beanstalk-created bucket, typically named something like `elasticbeanstalk-region-account-id`.

3. **Setting Up Lifecycle Policies**:
   - Go to the settings of your Elastic Beanstalk application.
   - Activate the application lifecycle policy.
   - You can configure the policy based on:
     - **Count**: Limit the number of application versions (e.g., keep a maximum of 200 versions).
     - **Age**: Limit the age of application versions (e.g., keep versions from the last 180 days).
   - Versions currently in use by your environments will not be deleted.

4. **Handling Source Bundles**:
   - Choose whether to retain or delete the source bundles from S3 when the versions are phased out:
     - **Retain Source Bundles**: Keeps the source files in S3 for recovery purposes.
     - **Delete Source Bundles**: Removes the source files from S3 to save storage space.
   
5. **Setting Deletion Role**:
   - Specify the role that allows Elastic Beanstalk to perform deletions. Typically, this would be the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service role.

### Summary

Implementing a lifecycle policy helps manage the number of application versions stored in Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring you do not exceed the limit of 1000 versions. By configuring policies based on count or age, and deciding whether to retain or delete source bundles in S3, you can efficiently manage storage and ensure the availability of necessary application versions. This process helps maintain a clean and organized application environment, facilitating smooth deployments and updates.

# Elastic Beanstalk Extensions Overview

Elastic Beanstalk (EB) extensions allow you to configure your environment with code instead of just using the UI. These configurations can include settings for the environment, resource definitions, and other parameters.

### Key Points about EB Extensions

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - EB extension files must be placed in the `.ebextensions/` directory at the root of your source code.
   - The files must be in either YAML or JSON format.
   - File extensions must end with `.config`, regardless of the actual format used (e.g., `logging.config`).

2. **Configuration Options**:
   - You can use `option_settings` to modify default settings.
   - Resources like RDS, ElastiCache, and DynamoDB can be added using EB extensions, which cannot be done through the Elastic Beanstalk console alone.
   - Any resources managed by EB extensions will be deleted if the environment is terminated.

### Example Usage of EB Extensions

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create EB Extensions Directory**:
   - Inside your application directory, create a folder named `.ebextensions/`.

2. **Add Configuration File**:
   - Inside `.ebextensions/`, create a file named `environment-variables.config`.

# How Elastic Beanstalk Works Under the Hood

Elastic Beanstalk leverages AWS CloudFormation to manage its infrastructure. CloudFormation allows you to define and provision AWS resources using infrastructure as code. This integration enables Elastic Beanstalk to configure and deploy a wide range of AWS services, providing a flexible and scalable environment for your applications.

### Key Points about Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation

1. **CloudFormation Integration**:
   - Elastic Beanstalk uses CloudFormation templates to set up the necessary infrastructure for your applications.
   - These templates include definitions for resources such as Auto Scaling groups, EC2 instances, security groups, load balancers, and more.

2. **Custom Resource Provisioning**:
   - You can use CloudFormation within Elastic Beanstalk extensions (`.ebextensions`) to provision additional resources like ElastiCache, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables.
   - This capability allows you to go beyond the default configurations available in the Elastic Beanstalk UI, giving you more control over your AWS environment.

3. **Viewing CloudFormation Stacks**:
   - Each Elastic Beanstalk environment corresponds to a CloudFormation stack. You can view these stacks in the CloudFormation console.
   - By examining the CloudFormation templates, you can see the resources that Elastic Beanstalk has created for your application.

### Example: Examining CloudFormation Stacks

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to CloudFormation Console**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to the CloudFormation service.
   - You will see stacks corresponding to your Elastic Beanstalk environments.

2. **Inspect a Stack**:
   - Select a stack (e.g., `eb-e-stack` for the `-en` environment).
   - Click on the "Template" tab to view the CloudFormation template. This template shows the configuration and resources created by Elastic Beanstalk.

3. **View Stack Resources**:
   - Click on the "Resources" tab to see a list of all resources created by the stack. For example, the `-en` stack might include:
     - Auto Scaling group
     - Launch configuration
     - Elastic IP (EIP)
     - EC2 security group

4. **Review Another Stack**:
   - Select another stack (e.g., `eb-e-stack` for the `-prod` environment).
   - This stack might include additional resources such as:
     - Scaling policies
     - CloudWatch alarms
     - Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
     - Listener rules
     - Target group

### Expanding Elastic Beanstalk with CloudFormation

Using CloudFormation within the `.ebextensions` directory allows you to extend your Elastic Beanstalk environment beyond its default capabilities. You can define additional AWS resources that are automatically provisioned and managed alongside your Elastic Beanstalk application. This approach provides greater flexibility and enables you to build more complex and integrated applications on AWS.

# Performing an Elastic Beanstalk Migration

#### Changing Load Balancer Type

Elastic Beanstalk environments are tied to their initial load balancer type. If you need to upgrade from a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Environment**:
   - Manually replicate the configuration of the original environment, but select the desired load balancer type for the new environment.
   - Note: The cloning feature copies the load balancer type, so it cannot be used for this purpose.

2. **Deploy Application to New Environment**:
   - Deploy your application to the newly created environment with the updated load balancer type.

3. **Shift Traffic to New Environment**:
   - Perform a CNAME swap: This involves changing the CNAME DNS record to point to the new environment.
   - Alternatively, use Amazon Route 53 to update the DNS settings, directing traffic to the new environment.

#### Decoupling RDS from Elastic Beanstalk

For production deployments, it is recommended to manage the RDS database independently of the Elastic Beanstalk environment. This prevents the database from being deleted if the Elastic Beanstalk environment is terminated. Follow these steps to decouple an RDS instance:

1. **Create an RDS Snapshot**:
   - Take a snapshot of your existing RDS database to safeguard your data.

2. **Enable Deletion Protection**:
   - In the RDS console, enable deletion protection for the RDS instance to prevent accidental deletion.

3. **Create a New Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
   - Set up a new environment without including an RDS instance.
   - Configure the application to connect to the existing RDS instance using environment variables or configuration files.

4. **Shift Traffic to New Environment**:
   - Perform a CNAME swap or update DNS settings using Route 53 to direct traffic to the new environment.

5. **Terminate the Old Environment**:
   - Once the new environment is verified to be working correctly, terminate the old Elastic Beanstalk environment.

6. **Clean Up CloudFormation Stack**:
   - The old environment's CloudFormation stack will enter a "Delete Failed" state due to the protected RDS instance.
   - Manually delete the CloudFormation stack to complete the cleanup process.

### Key Points

- **Load Balancer Migration**: Requires creating a new environment and manually replicating configurations.
- **RDS Decoupling**: Involves creating an RDS snapshot, enabling deletion protection, and configuring the new environment to use the existing RDS instance.
- **Traffic Shift**: Use CNAME swaps or Route 53 DNS updates to redirect traffic to the new environment.
- **Cleanup**: Ensure deletion protection is enabled to preserve the RDS instance, and manually delete any failed CloudFormation stacks.

These processes ensure that you can safely and effectively migrate Elastic Beanstalk environments and manage their associated resources.
