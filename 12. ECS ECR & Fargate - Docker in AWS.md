# Containers with Docker, ECS, and EKS

#### What is Docker?

Docker is a software development platform designed to deploy applications using container technology. Containers allow applications to be packaged in a standardized format, ensuring they run consistently across various environments. 

**Key Features of Docker:**
- **Standardization**: Containers ensure predictable behavior across different operating systems.
- **Compatibility**: Docker works with any language, OS, or technology.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for microservice architectures, migrating apps from on-premises to the cloud, and running any containerized application.

#### How Docker Works

Docker operates on an operating system by running a Docker agent on a server (such as EC2 instances). This agent can then start multiple Docker containers, each running different applications (e.g., Java, Node.js) or services (e.g., MySQL). Multiple instances of the same container can run simultaneously.

#### Docker Repositories

Docker images are stored in repositories:
- **Docker Hub**: A public repository with base images for many technologies and operating systems.
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: A private repository service by AWS, also offering a public gallery for image storage.

#### Docker vs. Virtual Machines

Docker containers share resources with the host system, making them lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs), which have separate guest operating systems. While Docker containers can share networking and data, they provide less isolation than VMs. This resource efficiency allows more containers to run on a single server.

**Architecture Comparison**:
- **VM**: Infrastructure → Host OS → Hypervisor → Guest OS → Applications.
- **Docker**: Infrastructure → Host OS → Docker Daemon → Containers.

#### Getting Started with Docker

1. **Dockerfile**: Define how the Docker container will look.
2. **Build**: Create a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
3. **Push**: Store the Docker image in a repository (Docker Hub or Amazon ECR).
4. **Pull and Run**: Retrieve the Docker image from the repository and run it as a container.

#### Docker Container Management on AWS

**Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**:
- AWS’s own Docker management platform.
- Facilitates running and managing Docker containers.

**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**:
- Managed Kubernetes service by AWS.
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**AWS Fargate**:
- Serverless container platform by AWS.
- Works with both ECS and EKS.
- Eliminates the need to manage underlying servers.

**Amazon ECR**:
- Used for storing Docker container images.
- Integrates with ECS and EKS for seamless container deployment.

#### Summary

Docker is a versatile and powerful container technology that simplifies app deployment and management. AWS offers several services to manage Docker containers effectively:
- **ECS** for Amazon’s Docker management.
- **EKS** for Kubernetes management.
- **Fargate** for serverless container execution.
- **ECR** for storing container images.

# Amazon ECS Overview

#### EC2 Launch Type

ECS (Elastic Container Service) allows you to run Docker containers on AWS. When using the EC2 launch type, you:

- Launch ECS tasks on an ECS cluster composed of EC2 instances.
- Provision and maintain the infrastructure yourself.
- Each EC2 instance must run the ECS agent, which registers the instance with the ECS service and specified ECS cluster.
- AWS starts or stops containers based on your ECS tasks, distributing them across the EC2 instances.

#### Fargate Launch Type

With the Fargate launch type:

- You run Docker containers on AWS without provisioning or managing EC2 instances.
- It's serverless; AWS manages the underlying infrastructure.
- You create task definitions to define your ECS tasks, specifying the CPU and RAM needed.
- AWS runs the ECS tasks, handling the infrastructure automatically.
- Scaling is straightforward—just increase the number of tasks.

Fargate is often preferred due to its simplicity and ease of management.

#### IAM Roles for ECS Tasks

**EC2 Launch Type:**

- **EC2 Instance Profile:** Used by the ECS agent to:
  - Make API calls to the ECS service to register the instance.
  - Send container logs to CloudWatch Logs.
  - Pull Docker images from ECR.
  - Access sensitive data in Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

**ECS Task Roles:**

- Applicable to both EC2 and Fargate launch types.
- Each ECS task can have a specific role allowing it to interact with different AWS services.
  - Task roles are defined in the task definition of your ECS service.

#### Load Balancer Integrations

To expose ECS tasks as HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, use:

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** 
  - Recommended for most use cases.
  - Supports integration with Fargate.

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
  - Recommended for very high throughput or high performance use cases.
  - Can be used with AWS PrivateLink.

- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):**
  - Not recommended due to lack of advanced features and incompatibility with Fargate.

#### Data Persistence on Amazon ECS

To share data across ECS tasks, use data volumes, particularly Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):

- **Amazon EFS:**
  - Compatible with both EC2 and Fargate launch types.
  - Provides persistent, multi-AZ shared storage.
  - Serverless and pay-as-you-go.
  - Allows tasks running in any AZ linked to the EFS file system to share data.

**Ultimate Combination:**

- **Fargate:** For serverless task management.
- **Amazon EFS:** For serverless, persistent storage. Ideal for multi-AZ shared storage for containers.

# ECS Service Auto Scaling Overview

#### Introduction to Auto Scaling
Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling enables you to automatically increase or decrease the number of ECS tasks based on demand. This is done through AWS Application Auto Scaling, which supports three primary metrics for scaling:

1. **CPU Utilization** of the ECS Service
2. **Memory Utilization** (RAM) of the ECS Service
3. **ALB Request Count Per Target** from the Application Load Balancer (ALB)

#### Types of Auto Scaling
1. **Target Tracking Scaling:**
   - Automatically adjusts the number of tasks to maintain a specified metric target.
   - Useful for maintaining a consistent utilization level for CPU, memory, or request count.

2. **Step Scaling:**
   - Increases or decreases the number of tasks by a specified amount based on the breach of CloudWatch alarms.

3. **Scheduled Scaling:**
   - Adjusts the number of tasks based on a pre-defined schedule.
   - Ideal for predictable changes, such as traffic patterns during certain times of the day.

#### Fargate vs. EC2 Launch Type
- **Fargate:**
  - Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers.
  - Makes service auto scaling simpler since there’s no need to manage the underlying EC2 instances.
  - Ideal for those looking for a hassle-free scaling experience.

- **EC2 Launch Type:**
  - Requires managing the EC2 instances where the tasks run.
  - Scaling the service at the task level does not equate to scaling the EC2 instances in the cluster.

#### Scaling EC2 Instances in the Backend
When using the EC2 launch type, scaling the backend EC2 instances can be managed in two ways:

1. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Scaling:**
   - Adjusts the number of EC2 instances in an ASG based on metrics such as CPU Utilization.
   - Adds EC2 instances when CPU utilization increases.

2. **ECS Cluster Capacity Provider:**
   - An advanced feature that intelligently manages the capacity of the ECS cluster.
   - Automatically scales the ASG when additional capacity (CPU/RAM) is needed.
   - Preferred over manual ASG scaling due to its efficiency and automation.

#### Workflow of Auto Scaling
1. **Service with Initial Tasks:**
   - Example: Service A starts with two tasks.

2. **Increase in CPU Usage:**
   - Increased demand leads to higher CPU usage.

3. **CloudWatch Monitoring:**
   - CloudWatch monitors the CPU usage.
   - A CloudWatch alarm is triggered when the CPU usage exceeds the specified threshold.

4. **Triggering Scaling Activity:**
   - The alarm triggers a scaling activity in AWS Application Auto Scaling.
   - The desired capacity of the ECS service increases.

5. **Launching New Tasks:**
   - New tasks are created to handle the increased load.

6. **Scaling EC2 Instances (if using EC2 launch type):**
   - **ECS Capacity Provider:** Automatically scales the ASG by adding new EC2 instances when needed.
   - Ensures that there is sufficient capacity to run the new tasks.

By leveraging ECS Service Auto Scaling, you can ensure that your application scales efficiently in response to changes in demand, providing consistent performance while optimizing resource usage.

# Updating an ECS Service with Rolling Updates

When updating an ECS service from one version to another (e.g., from v1 to v2), you can manage the process using rolling updates. This involves controlling the number of tasks started and stopped at a time, ensuring minimal disruption. Two key settings for rolling updates are the **Minimum Healthy Percent** and the **Maximum Percent**.

#### Key Settings:
- **Minimum Healthy Percent**: Defines the minimum number of tasks that must be running and healthy during the update. By default, it is set to 100%, meaning all tasks must remain healthy.
- **Maximum Percent**: Defines the maximum number of tasks that can run during the update. By default, it is set to 200%, allowing for the current number of tasks plus an equal number of new tasks.

#### Example Scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Minimum 50%, Maximum 100%**
   - **Initial Setup**: 4 tasks running (100% capacity)
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Terminate 2 tasks**: Running at 50% capacity.
     2. **Create 2 new tasks**: Back to 100% capacity with new tasks.
     3. **Terminate 2 old tasks**: Back to 50% capacity.
     4. **Create 2 new tasks**: Back to 100% capacity with all new tasks.
   - **Result**: Gradual replacement of old tasks with new tasks, maintaining at least 50% capacity at all times.

2. **Scenario 2: Minimum 100%, Maximum 150%**
   - **Initial Setup**: 4 tasks running (100% capacity)
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Create 2 new tasks**: Capacity increases to 150%.
     2. **Terminate 2 old tasks**: Back to 100% capacity.
     3. **Create 2 new tasks**: Capacity increases to 150% again.
     4. **Terminate 2 old tasks**: Back to 100% capacity with all new tasks.
   - **Result**: Maintains full capacity throughout the update, ensuring no downtime.

#### Workflow:

1. **Initiate Update**: Choose the new task definition version (e.g., v2).
2. **Rolling Update Process**:
   - **Minimum Healthy Percent** dictates the minimum capacity to maintain.
   - **Maximum Percent** allows the ECS to temporarily exceed normal capacity.
   - ECS starts and stops tasks in phases, ensuring minimum disruption.
3. **Completion**: All old tasks are replaced by new ones, adhering to the specified update strategy.

Using these settings, ECS ensures a smooth transition from the old version to the new version, maintaining service availability and performance. This methodical approach prevents significant disruptions during updates, providing a robust and reliable way to manage ECS services.

# Amazon ECS Task Definitions: In-Depth Explanation

Amazon ECS task definitions are essential in telling the ECS service how to run one or more Docker containers. They are defined in JSON format, and the console provides a UI to help create this JSON. Key elements within a task definition include image name, port bindings, memory, CPU, environment variables, networking information, IAM role, and logging configuration.

#### Key Components of ECS Task Definitions

1. **Image Name**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container.
2. **Port Binding**:
   - **Container Port**: The port on the container where the application is running.
   - **Host Port** (for EC2 launch type): The port on the host (EC2 instance) that maps to the container port.
3. **Memory and CPU**: The amount of memory and CPU resources required for the container.
4. **Environment Variables**: Configuration settings passed to the container.
5. **Networking Information**: Defines how the container interacts with other network resources.
6. **IAM Role**: Permissions that allow the container to interact with other AWS services.
7. **Logging Configuration**: Setup for logging, such as CloudWatch Logs.

#### Example Scenario

For instance, consider an ECS task running an Apache HTTP server on an EC2 instance. The task definition would include:

- **Container Port**: 80 (where the HTTP server is running).
- **Host Port**: Mapped to a port on the EC2 instance (e.g., 8080).

This setup enables external access to the HTTP server running in the container through the EC2 instance’s port.

#### Multiple Containers per Task Definition

You can define up to 10 containers per task definition, useful for creating sidecar containers that assist with logging, monitoring, or other ancillary functions.

#### Deep Dive into Port Mapping

- **Dynamic Host Port Mapping (EC2 launch type)**:
  - If only the container port is defined and the host port is set to 0, the host port will be dynamically assigned.
  - The Application Load Balancer (ALB) automatically knows how to route traffic to the correct dynamically assigned host ports, a feature not available with the Classic Load Balancer.

- **Fargate Launch Type**:
  - Each ECS task receives a unique private IP address.
  - No host port definition is needed; only the container ports are defined.
  - ALB connects to these tasks using their private IP addresses and defined container ports.

#### IAM Roles in ECS

IAM roles are assigned at the task definition level, not the service level. Each task within a service inherits the IAM role defined in the task definition, allowing tasks to securely access AWS resources like S3 or DynamoDB.

#### Environment Variables

- **Hard-Coded Variables**: Directly specified within the task definition.
- **Sensitive Variables**: Use SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to store sensitive information such as API keys or passwords. These values are fetched at runtime and injected into the container as environment variables.
- **Bulk Loading**: Environment variables can also be loaded from an S3 bucket file.

#### Sharing Data Between ECS Tasks

To share data between multiple containers within a task, you can use data volumes:

- **Bind Mounts**: Shared storage volumes defined in the task definition.
  - **EC2 Tasks**: Bind mounts use the EC2 instance storage.
  - **Fargate Tasks**: Bind mounts use ephemeral storage, tied to the container's lifecycle.

For example, application containers can write logs to a shared storage location, and a sidecar container can read these logs to forward them to a centralized logging service.

#### Summary

Amazon ECS task definitions provide a comprehensive way to define how Docker containers run in an ECS cluster. Key components include container configurations, resource requirements, environment variables, IAM roles, and networking setups. Understanding these elements and their interactions is crucial for effectively managing ECS-based applications.

# ECS Task Placement Strategies and Constraints: Detailed Explanation

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) provides various strategies and constraints to control how tasks are placed on EC2 instances within a cluster. Understanding these concepts is crucial for optimizing resource utilization, ensuring high availability, and managing costs efficiently.

#### 1. **Task Placement Process**

When ECS needs to place or scale tasks within an EC2 cluster, it follows a structured process:

- **Identify Instances**: ECS first identifies EC2 instances that meet the CPU, memory, and port requirements specified in the task definition.
  
- **Apply Constraints**: It then considers any task placement constraints defined for the task.
  
- **Apply Strategies**: Finally, ECS applies a task placement strategy to select the optimal instance based on the strategy's criteria (e.g., binpack, spread, or random).

#### 2. **Task Placement Strategies**

Task placement strategies dictate how ECS chooses an instance for placing new tasks. Here are the main strategies:

- **Binpack**: Maximizes instance utilization by placing tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use and can result in cost savings.
  
  **JSON Definition**: 
  ```json
  {
    "type": "binpack",
    "field": "memory"
  }
  ```
  
- **Spread**: Spreads tasks evenly across instances, typically in different availability zones (AZs) or instance IDs to improve fault tolerance and high availability.
  
  **JSON Definition**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "spread",
    "field": "availability-zone"
  }
  ```
  
- **Random**: Places tasks randomly across available instances without any specific logic or optimization.
  
  **JSON Definition**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "random"
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Task Placement Constraints**

Constraints provide rules that restrict where tasks can be placed. These are particularly useful for compliance, performance optimization, or regulatory requirements.

- **DistinctInstance**: Ensures that each task is placed on a different container instance. This is useful for redundancy and minimizing risk.
  
  **JSON Definition**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "distinctInstance"
  }
  ```
  
- **MemberOf**: Specifies that tasks should be placed only on instances that satisfy an expression in the Cluster Query Language (CQL). This allows precise control over task placement based on instance attributes such as instance type or custom tags.
  
  **Example JSON**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "memberOf",
    "expression": "attribute:instance-type =~ t2.*"
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Mixing Strategies and Constraints**

ECS allows mixing different strategies and constraints to tailor placement behavior according to specific needs. For example, combining spread across availability zones with a binpack strategy based on memory can optimize both fault tolerance and resource utilization.

#### 5. **Use Cases and Considerations**

- **Cost Optimization**: Binpack strategy reduces the number of EC2 instances in use, thus lowering costs by maximizing utilization.
  
- **High Availability**: Spread strategy ensures tasks are distributed across different AZs or instances, reducing the impact of failures.
  
- **Compliance**: Constraints like distinctInstance can ensure regulatory requirements are met by preventing co-location of sensitive tasks.

#### Conclusion

Understanding ECS task placement strategies and constraints is essential for designing efficient, resilient, and cost-effective containerized applications on AWS ECS. These concepts not only optimize resource utilization but also enhance the reliability and scalability of ECS deployments.
