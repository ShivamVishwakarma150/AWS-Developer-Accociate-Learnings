# Firewalls and Security Groups in AWS

#### Overview
Firewalls are essential for protecting your EC2 instances from unauthorized access and controlling the traffic that goes in and out of your instances. In AWS, these firewalls are implemented using **security groups**.

#### Security Groups
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. Here are some key points about security groups:

1. **Allow Rules Only**: Security groups in AWS only contain rules that specify what traffic is allowed. There are no explicit deny rules.

2. **Rules Referencing**: Security groups can reference IP addresses or other security groups. This means you can allow traffic based on the source IP address or another security group.

#### Example Scenario
Imagine you have a computer on the public internet, and you want to access your EC2 instance. You would create a security group around your EC2 instance with specific rules:

- **Inbound Traffic**: Rules that specify what traffic is allowed to enter your EC2 instance.
- **Outbound Traffic**: Rules that specify what traffic is allowed to leave your EC2 instance.

#### Security Group Rules
Rules within a security group are defined by:

- **Type**: The type of traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
- **Protocol**: The protocol used (e.g., TCP).
- **Port Range**: The port or range of ports the traffic is allowed to use.
- **Source/Destination**: The IP address or range of IP addresses from which traffic is allowed or to which traffic is sent.

For example, allowing SSH access from a specific IP address might look like this:
- **Type**: SSH
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Port**: 22
- **Source**: Your IP address (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24)

#### Important Characteristics
1. **Multiple Attachments**: Security groups can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, and a single EC2 instance can have multiple security groups attached to it.

2. **Region and VPC Specific**: Security groups are specific to a region and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). If you change regions or create a new VPC, you will need to create new security groups.

3. **Firewall Location**: Security groups act outside the EC2 instance. If traffic is blocked by the security group, the EC2 instance does not see it.

#### Practical Advice
- **Separate SSH Access**: It is recommended to have a separate security group for SSH access to ensure it is configured correctly.

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - **Timeout**: If you experience a timeout when trying to access your EC2 instance, it is likely a security group issue blocking the traffic.
  - **Connection Refused**: If you get a "connection refused" message, the traffic reached the instance, but the application on the instance is not accepting the connection.

#### Default Behavior
- **Inbound Traffic**: By default, all inbound traffic is blocked.
- **Outbound Traffic**: By default, all outbound traffic is allowed.

#### Advanced Feature: Referencing Other Security Groups
You can configure security group rules to reference other security groups, which is useful for instances that need to communicate with each other. For example:

- **Security Group 1** allows inbound traffic from **Security Group 2**.
- Any instance with **Security Group 2** can communicate with instances that have **Security Group 1** attached.

This setup helps manage complex architectures without worrying about individual IP addresses.

### Ports You Need to Know
Certain ports are commonly used and are important to know for configuring security groups:

- **SSH (Port 22)**: Used to login to EC2 instances running Linux.
- **FTP (Port 21)**: Used for File Transfer Protocol.
- **SFTP (Port 22)**: Secure FTP using SSH.
- **HTTP (Port 80)**: Used to access unsecured websites.
- **HTTPS (Port 443)**: Used to access secured websites.
- **RDP (Port 3389)**: Used to login to EC2 instances running Windows.

### Summary
Understanding security groups is crucial for managing network security in AWS. They provide a flexible and powerful way to control access to your EC2 instances and ensure that only authorized traffic can reach your resources. With the proper configuration and understanding of these concepts, you can effectively secure your AWS environment.

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote machine over a network. When dealing with cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), SSH is essential for managing and controlling virtual servers, such as EC2 instances, from your local machine's terminal or command line interface.

#### Diagram Overview

Imagine you have an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2. This instance has a public IP address, which allows you to access it over the internet. For security purposes, the instance is associated with a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 22 (the default port for SSH).

#### Steps to SSH into the EC2 Instance

1. **Locate the Public IP and DNS:**
   - Go to your EC2 instance console on AWS.
   - Find the public DNS and public IP address of your instance. This information is crucial for establishing the SSH connection.

2. **Verify Security Group Settings:**
   - Ensure that your security group allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH).
   - The source should be `0.0.0.0/0`, which means any IP address can attempt to connect.

3. **Open Your Terminal:**
   - On Linux or Mac, you can use the default terminal application. On Mac, tools like iTerm can also be used.

4. **Initial SSH Attempt:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     ssh ec2-user@[your_instance_public_IP]
     ```
   - Replace `[your_instance_public_IP]` with the actual public IP of your EC2 instance.
   - You will get a warning to verify the authenticity of the host. Type `yes` to continue.

5. **Key Pair Requirement:**
   - If you receive a "Permission denied" message, it's because you need to authenticate using the private key (.pem file) associated with the EC2 instance.

6. **Using the PEM File:**
   - Ensure you have downloaded the .pem file when you created the EC2 instance. Move this file to a directory where you can easily reference it.
   - Modify the SSH command to include the .pem file:
     ```
     ssh -i /path_to_your_key/EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@[your_instance_public_IP]
     ```
   - The `-i` option specifies the identity file (your .pem file).

7. **Fixing Key File Permissions:**
   - If you see a "unprotected private key file" warning, it's because the permissions of your .pem file are too open.
   - Change the permissions of the .pem file to be more restrictive:
     ```
     chmod 0400 /path_to_your_key/EC2Tutorial.pem
     ```
   - This command ensures that only the owner of the file can read it.

8. **Successful SSH Connection:**
   - Run the SSH command again:
     ```
     ssh -i /path_to_your_key/EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@[your_instance_public_IP]
     ```
   - You should now be connected to your EC2 instance. You will see a welcome message indicating you are logged into the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

#### Verifying the Connection

- You can run basic commands to verify your connection:
  - `whoami` to see the current user, which should be `ec2-user`.
  - `ping google.com` to test network connectivity from your EC2 instance.

#### Exiting the SSH Session

- To exit the SSH session, type `exit` or press `Control + D`. This will close the connection and return you to your local machine's terminal.

#### Summary

- **Command to SSH:**
  ```
  ssh -i /path_to_your_key/EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@[your_instance_public_IP]
  ```

- **Steps:**
  - Open terminal.
  - Ensure port 22 is open in the security group.
  - Use the SSH command with the appropriate `.pem` file.
  - Adjust file permissions if necessary.
  - Verify the connection.

By following these steps, you can securely SSH into your EC2 instance and perform various administrative tasks directly from your terminal. This method is fundamental for managing remote servers in the cloud.
